# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
- We had a few projects we worked on during this course, but the most in depth one we went over is using the Q-Learning algorithms and having the maze being created and having the pirate go through and find the treasure using reinforced learning methods. We were given the code for the neural network and most of the functionality of the maze and the game itself and then we implemented the learning portion where the pirate would go through the maze and learn from their mistakes and eventualy would be able to figure out the maze faster each time.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
# A. What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
     - computer scientists do so many things its hard to exactly explain. But in general they use software and computers and systems to test and automate and figure things out or solve problems. Lots of things can be either solved or created by computer scientists that are either beneficial or not, depending on who the person is creating the software.
# B. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
    - as a computer scientist it is always best to get al the facts that are available first. Figure out how things work, why they work, what the purpose of them is. Everything must be analyzed as the first approach as a computer scientist. After that it is a lot of planning and layouts to make sure everything is right the first time around.
# C. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    - the responsibilities ethically are to make sure you lay out the guidelines of the product produced. Makes sure it isn't able to do anything that is harmful that wasn't meant to be done with the device or software. MAke sure the company doesn't get sued for bad product and that the user doesn;t get injured or injure someone else. Everything along those lines must be covered and tested and discussed as the developer.
